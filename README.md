Analysis of DC permit process 


The codes in this repo are directed towards analyzing the DCRA permit process. The codes encompass various stages of the task:
1. Merging the primary and supplementary datasets
2. cleaning the merged dataset and creating a dataset to model upon
3. Comparison of models - Naive Bayes, Logit, Decision Tree, KNN and their ROCs
4. Further analysis of Decision tree and Logit
